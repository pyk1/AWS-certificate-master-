# AWS Trusted Advisor

Trusted Advisor inspects the AWS environment to make recommendations for system performance, saving money, availability and closing security gaps

Trusted Advisor checks the following four categories

* **Cost Optimization**
  * Recommendations that can potentially save money by highlighting unused resources and opportunities to reduce your bill.
* **Security**
  * Identification of security settings and gaps, inline with the best practices, that could make the AWS solution less secure
* **Fault Tolerance**
  * Recommendations that help increase the resiliency and availability of the AWS solution by highlighting redundancy shortfalls, current service limits, and over-utilized resources.
* **Performance**
  * Recommendations that can help to improve the speed and responsiveness of the applications
* **Service Limits**

  * Checks for service usage that is more than 80% of the service limit.
  * Values are based on a snapshot, so the current usage might differ.
  * Limit and usage data can take up to 24 hours to reflect any changes
