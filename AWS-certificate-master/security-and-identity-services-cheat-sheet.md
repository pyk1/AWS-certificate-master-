## IAM

* securely control access to AWS services and resources
* helps create and manage user identities and grant permissions for those users to access AWS resources
* helps create groups for multiple users with similar permissions
* not appropriate for application authentication
* is Global and does not need to be migrated to a different region
* helps define Policies,
  * in JSON format
  * all permissions are implicitly denied by default
  * most restrictive policy wins
* **IAM Role**
  * helps grants and delegate access to users and services without the need of creating permanent credentials
  * IAM users or AWS services can assume a role to obtain temporary security credentials that can be used to make AWS API calls
  * needs Trust policy to define who and Permission policy to define what the user or service can access
  * used with Security Token Service \(STS\), a lightweight web service that provides temporary, limited privilege credentials for IAM users or for authenticated federated users
  * IAM role scenarios
    * Service access _for e.g. EC2 to access S3 or DynamoDB_
    * Cross Account access for users
      * with user within the same account
      * with user within an AWS account owned the same owner
      * with user from a Third Party AWS account with External ID for enhanced security
    * Identity Providers & Federation
      * Web Identity Federation, where the user can be authenticated using external authentication Identity providers like Amazon, Google or any OpenId IdP using AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity
      * Identity Provider using SAML 2.0, where the user can be authenticated using on premises Active Directory, Open Ldap or any SAML 2.0 compliant IdP using AssumeRoleWithSAML
      * For other Identity Providers, use Identity Broker to authenticate and provide temporary Credentials using AssumeRole \(recommended\) or GetFederationToken
* **IAM Best Practices**
  * Do not use Root account for anything other than billing
  * Create Individual IAM users
  * Use groups to assign permissions to IAM users
  * Grant least privilege
  * Use IAM roles for applications on EC2
  * Delegate using roles instead of sharing credentials
  * Rotate credentials regularly
  * Use Policy conditions for increased granularity
  * Use CloudTrail to keep a history of activity
  * Enforce a strong IAM password policy for IAM users
  * Remove all unused users and credentials

## CloudHSM

* provides **secure cryptographic key storage **to customers by making hardware security modules \(HSMs\) available in the AWS cloud
* **single tenant, dedicated physical device **to securely generate, store, and manage cryptographic keys used for data encryption
* are **inside the VPC **\(not EC2-classic\) & isolated from the rest of the network
* can use VPC peering to connect to CloudHSM from multiple VPCs
* integrated with Amazon Redshift and Amazon RDS for Oracle
* EBS volume encryption, S3 object encryption and key management can be done with CloudHSM but requires custom application scripting
* is **NOT fault tolerant **and would need to build a cluster as if one fails all the keys are lost
* **expensive, **prefer AWS Key Management Service \(KMS\) if cost is a criteria

## AWS Directory Services

* gives applications in AWS access to Active Directory services
* different from SAML + AD, where the access is granted to AWS services through Temporary Credentials
* Simple AD
  * least expensive but does not support Microsoft AD advance features
  * provides a Samba 4 Microsoft Active Directory compatible standalone directory service on AWS
  * No single point of Authentication or Authorization, as a separate copy is maintained
  * trust relationships cannot be setup between Simple AD and other Active Directory domains
  * Donâ€™t use it, if the requirement is to leverage access and control through centralized authentication service
* AD Connector
  * acts just as an hosted proxy service for instances in AWS to connect to on-premises Active Directory
  * enables consistent enforcement of existing security policies, such as password expiration, password history, and account lockouts, whether users are accessing resources on-premises or in the AWS cloud
  * needs VPN connectivity \(or Direct Connect\)
  * integrates with existing RADIUS-based MFA solutions to enabled multi-factor authentication
  * does not cache data which might lead to latency
* Read-only Domain Controllers \(RODCs\)
  * works out as a Read-only Active Directory
  * holds a copy of the Active Directory Domain Service \(AD DS\) database and respond to authentication requests
  * they cannot be written to and are typically deployed in locations where physical security cannot be guaranteed
  * helps maintain a single point to authentication  & authorization controls, however needs to be synced
* Writable Domain Controllers
  * are expensive to setup
  * operate in a multi-master model; changes can be made on any writable server in the forest, and those changes are replicated to servers throughout the entire forest

## AWS WAF

* is a web application firewall that helps monitor the HTTP/HTTPS requests forwarded to CloudFront and allows controlling access to the content.
* helps define Web ACLs, which is a combination of Rules, which is a combinations of Conditions and Action to block or allow
* Third Party WAF
  * act as filters that apply a set of rules to web traffic to cover exploits like XSS and SQL injection and also help build resiliency against DDoS by mitigating HTTP GET or POST floods
  * WAF provides a lot of features like OWASP Top 10, HTTP rate limiting, Whitelist or blacklist, inspect and identify requests with abnormal patterns, CAPTCHA etc
  * a **WAF sandwich **pattern can be implemented where an autoscaled WAF sits between the Internet and Internal Load Balancer
