2. \_\_You configured ELB to perform health checks on these EC2 instances. If an instance fails to pass health checks what can we assume the ELB will do?
3. \_\_for a DB instance the default setting for minor upgrades is set to

7. \_\_\_\_\_is a service where you buy devices more akin to a hard disk that can be attached to one \(and only one -at the time of writing\) EC2 instance

A, EBS \(Elastic Block Store\)

B, The automated snapshot will be deleted

C, All data on instance-store devices will be lost, a very abstract answer the underlying host for the instance is changed

D, enable S3 versioning on the bucket

E, You will be asked if you wish to create a final snapshot

F, yes, allow auto minor version upgrades

G, The ELB stops sending traffic to the instance that failed its health check
